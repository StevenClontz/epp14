# EPP14

My team (Ecru) won 
[Eric's fourteenth puzzle party](http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2014/)
on Saturday, April 12, 2014.

This year I had the pleasure
of working with several talented puzzlers, none of whom I had ever
played with before. However, I actually didn't do too much puzzling with other
team members. Instead I found myself
wielding my laptop in the corner of our headquarters as the team's coder. 
As in previous years, several of the puzzles lended themselves to 
programmatic analysis.

## About this repository

I solved three puzzles from Eric's Puzzle Party 14 using programming:
two using custom Ruby code, and one adapting an existing Python library.

Each of the folders has a separate README outlining my thought process for
the puzzle, and explaining the code I wrote/adapted to get my solution.

Everything is as-is, and there are definitely some inoptimal portions,
if not mistakes. But it was good enough to do well in all three
puzzles.

## About puzzle parties

Puzzle parties, also known as puzzlehunts and puzzle races, are a wide
class of competitions where teams of players rush to solve a collection
of "puzzles" (riddles, codes, logic puzzles, etc.) in as little time as
possible. Often, solutions point to physical locations, where new puzzles
or tokens can be found which point to the next challenge or award points
for successful teams.

myself and puzzles at my website:
